    "\n",
    "It is called a time option because of the American-style exercise feature. \n",
    "The holder can choose in this period to exercise parts of the total amount, \n",
    "but the total amount and no more must be exercised before or at time $T_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the EUR/USD as the target exchange rate. A long position in a EUR\n",
    "time option receives EUR at the exercise dates and pays USD. \n",

    "a fixed future date. \n",

    "In [Merton (1973)](../readings/r1_merton1973.html), we saw in :eqref:`callbounds` \n",
    "there were bounds on the price of a call option. \n",

    "We can prove similar bounds for any option with a single payoff time using a portfolio of\n",
    "the underlying and a risk-free bond. The main idea consists in creating a portfolio\n",

    "which dominates the option payoff at expiry, and for the most expensive \n",
    "portfolio dominated by it at expiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff of a portfolio of stocks and zero-coupond bonds is a linear function, and hence\n",
    "what we are in effect doing is looking for a closest straight lines above and below the payoff.\n",

    "In this problem, you are asked to use the same approach to find the bounds on a digital call \n",
    "option with strike $K$ and expiry $T$ on a non-dividend paying stock. \n",
