    "## Square-root payoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S_t$ be the value of a traded asset and $Y_t = \\sqrt{S_t}$ the value of another traded asset in\n",
    "the same market as $S_t$ for all $t \\geq 0$. The risk-neutral dynamics of $S_t$ are given by\n",
    "$$dS_t = S_t \\left[r dt + \\sigma dW_t \\right]$$\n",
    "in which both the risk-free rate $r$ and the volatility $\\sigma$ are known constants.\n",

    "### Arbitrage-free price of a square-root payoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a European claim with payoff $X_T = \\sqrt{S_T}$ at expiry $T$, and assume\n",
    "that the market containing the asset $S_t$ , the money market account and the\n",

    "## Best-of-two option\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff of the best-of-two option is a function of two stock prices $S_t^1$ and $S_t^2$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Take one of the stocks as numeraire and apply change of numeraire techniques to derive the formula for the price of the option.\n",

    "### Pricing formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the pricing formula in a jupyter notebook and plot graphs to show how the option price vary for a range of values of the parameters $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, $\\rho$. You can use $r = 0.02$, $T = 1$ and for each following combination of initial stock prices $(100,100)$, $(50,100)$, $(80,100)$, $(90,100)$, vary both volatilities in the range $[0,0.4]$ by steps of $0.02$, and correlation in the range $[âˆ’1,1]$ in steps of $0.02$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option sensitivity to volatilities and correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your graphs, what do you deduce about the sensitivity of the option price with respect to volatilities and correlation and verify your conclusions with mathematical analysis of the option pricing formula.\n",

    "convergence of the Binomial pricing formula to the Black-Scholes formula for an\n",
    "increasing number of time steps using the following parameters initial stock price $S_0 =\n",
    "100$, strike price $K=100$, time to expiry $T=1$, risk-free rate $r =5\\%$ and volatility $\\sigma=20\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implied Binomial trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the stock price of Microsoft (MSFT) trades at $\\$30$. Assume that you observe the following set of MSFT options:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Maturity | Strike | Call | Put |\n",
    "|----------|--------|------|-----|\n",

    "\n",
    "Assume further that the continuously compounded interest rate is $r = 0.02$, and that the dividend yield is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pricing European options with a binomial tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a two-period implied binomial tree that fits this set of options exactly. Each period will be for one month. Your tree will have an initial node and two periods thereafter. At each node in the tree, show the stock price and the branching probability. State clearly any assumptions you make.\n",

    "## Compound options\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S_t$ be the value of a traded asset with risk-neutral dynamics given by the classical Black-Scholes model:\n",
    "$$dS_t = S_t \\left[ r dt + \\sigma dW_t \\right],$$\n",
    "where $W_t$ is a brownian motion, $\\sigma$ is a constant volatility parameter and the short rate $r$ is also constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the formula for the call option $C_1(t,S)$. Using the fact that $\\frac{\\partial C_1}{\\partial S} > 0$, deduce that \n",
    "$C_2$ is exercised if and only if $S_{T_2}$ is larger than $S^*$ where $S^*$ is implicitly characterized by $C_1(T_2, S^*) = K_2$. \n",
