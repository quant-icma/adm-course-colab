    "\n",
    "This course provides a solid introduction to derivatives modelling, blending theoretical and mathematical derivations with programming implementation. It is a relatively advanced introduction. It will not make you an expert on the subject but it does go beyond the Black-Scholes-Merton model, exploring implications of loosening the various assumptions that underlie the Black-Scholes-Merton model and theory. The course assumes you have taken at least a one-semester course on stochastic calculus. It also assumes that you have studied (or are currently studying) an introductory course on Black-Scholes-Merton - the Derivatives Modelling course at the ICMA centre - pricing of vanilla European options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking this course, you expect to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - acquire a good understanding of arbitrage pricing and replication theory and practice,\n",
    "  - get some exposure to derivatives modelling beyond Black-Scholes-Merton model,\n",
    "  - learn about modelling derivatives beyond the Vanilla European Calls and Puts\n",
    "  - practice implementing derivatives models, i.e. get your 'hands dirty' at coding model,\n",
    "  - gain insights into assumptions and limitations of models and their scope of usefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Stochastic Calculus\n",
