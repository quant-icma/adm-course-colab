    "## The assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- short term rate is constant and known\n",
    "- Lognormal model of the stock\n",
    "- No dividends\n",
    "- European exercise\n",
    "- No transaction costs\n",
    "- Unlimited funding and borrowing at the risk-free short rate\n",
    "- No short-selling restrictions\n",
    "- Continuous-time trading in arbitrary fractions of the stock\n",
    "\n",
    "## The idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversify the risk and use CAPM or delta-hedging. We look at the delta-hedging approach to remove the sensitivity \n",
    "to the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stochastic differential equation of the stock is given by\n",
    "$$dS_t = S_t \\left[\\mu dt + \\sigma dW_t\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of the bank account numeraire used to borrow any required funds to maintain the replication strategy or\n",
    "invest any excess fund is given by\n",
    "$$d\\beta_t = r \\beta_t dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Ito's lemma, the evolution of the call price $C$ is given by\n",
    "$$dC = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} dt + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S}dS + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2S^2 dt$$\n",

    "Replacing $dS$ by its expression and grouping all the terms in $dt$ we have\n",
    "$$dC = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} \\mu S + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2S^2 \\right] dt + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} \\sigma S dW_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of the call and the stock depend only on the same brownian motion term, and so \n",
    "if we combine them into a portfolio with well-chosen quantities, we should be able \n",
    "to eliminate or hedge the risk by getting it to cancel out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\pi$ be the portfolio with one call and $\\Delta$ stock:\n",
    "$$\\pi = \\Delta S + C$$\n",
    "then \n",
    "$$d\\pi = \\Delta dS + dC = \\left[\\dots\\right] dt + \\Delta S \\sigma dW + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} \\sigma S dW$$\n",
    "To eliminate the risk, we need\n",
    "$$\\Delta S \\sigma dW + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} \\sigma S dW = 0$$\n",
    "Hence \n",
    "$$\\Delta = -\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S}$$\n",
    "and given the portfolio is risk-less, it should only earn the risk-free rate\n",
