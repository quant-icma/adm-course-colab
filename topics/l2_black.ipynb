    "## European option pricing with Black-Scholes model\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Black and Scholes (1973)](../readings/r5_blackscholes.html), we saw a proof \n",
    "of the Black-Scholes PDE using a hedging or replication argument where the option is\n",
    "replicated with a continous-time dynamic replication with the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we look at a probabilistic/martingale approach to derive the formula\n",

    "## First look at the Profit and Loss of a delta-hedged option\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Black and Scholes (1973)](../readings/r5_blackscholes.html), we saw that the change \n",
    "in value of a portfolio with a delta-hedged option $\\pi = \\Delta S + C$ is given by\n",
    "$$d\\pi = \\Theta dt + \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma \\sigma^2 S^2 dt$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$\\Theta = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$ and $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second term is quadratic in $dS$ and much smaller than the linear change in value of $\\pi$ \n",
    "proportional to $dS$ which has been canceled out by the delta hedging. We have also seen in \n",
    "previous lectures that options have positive convexity, i.e. the $\\Gamma$ is positive. Hence,\n",
    "a delta-hedged option benefits from the convexity or curvature of the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the risk has been removed by the delta-hedging, we also saw that means the portfolio\n",
    "should earn the risk-free rate and thus:\n",
    "$$\\Theta + \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma \\sigma^2 S^2 = r \\pi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's ignore the interest rates for now, i.e. assume $r=0$ for the rest of this section.\n",
    "Then\n",
    "$$\\Theta = -\\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma \\sigma^2 S^2$$\n",
    "and so $\\Theta dt$ is the time decay that offsets the gain from convexity as the option gets closer to expiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Black-Scholes formula, all the inputs are known except for the volatility $\\sigma$. \n",
    "The value of $\\sigma$ that matches the model output to market prices is called the implied volatility\n",
    "which we denote $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "It is the value that the __unknown future__ volatility has to be in order that the model will have\n",
    "valued the option correctly ex-ante. We could say that the implied volatility is the market's expected\n",
    "value of future volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the future realized $\\sigma$ ends up greater that the implied value $\\Sigma$, the delta-hedged option\n",
    "will increase in value more than expected. Similarly, if the $\\sigma$ ends up lower that $\\Sigma$,\n",
    "then the delta-hedged option will appreciate less than anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount we expect to lose due to time decay during $dt$ is \n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma \\Sigma^2 S^2 dt$$\n",
    "while the gain from convexity if the stock is actually moving with a volatity of $\\sigma$ is\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma \\sigma^2 S^2 dt$$\n",
    "and thus the infinitesimal profit or loss after time $dt$ is given by\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma S^2 (\\sigma^2-\\Sigma^2) dt$$\n",
    "This shows that when we delta-hedge an option, we are in effect take a position on volatility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a long position in the delta-hedged option profits from higher realized volatility\n",
    "- a short position in the delta-hedged option profits from lower realized volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option pricing with the Binomial tree\n",
    "\n",
    "In this [two-step visualization](AmericanCRR.pdf), we build the intuition with a numerical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assignment, you implement the bionomial tree of pricing European options and show \n",
    "numerically the convergence to Black-Scholes formula as the discrete time steps converge to\n",
    "zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original [Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979)](../readings/r4_crr.html), the convergence to\n",
    "Black-Scholes formula is proven.\n",
